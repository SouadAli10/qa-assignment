# Test Report: Todo List API Assessment
Executive Summary
This report documents the findings from testing the Todo List API and its associated frontend application. The testing covered core functionality, security, performance, and user interface aspects. Several critical issues were identified along with implemented improvements.

## Critical Findings
### Authentication & Authorization Issues
Severity: High

Finding: Login and user separation is not properly implemented in the current version

Impact: We do not have users so anyone using this app can see the other person's todos

Recommendation: Implement proper user isolation with JWT verification and user-specific data filtering

### Data Cleanup Implementation
Action Taken: Added a "Delete All Todos" API endpoint

Purpose: Ensures clean test environment between test runs

Implementation:

Added to both API and frontend

Integrated into test cleanup procedures

## Frontend Issues
### Theme Functionality
Severity: Medium

Finding: Dark theme toggle does not work as expected

Symptoms:

Theme selection does not persist

UI elements don't properly adapt to dark mode

Root Cause: Missing state persistence and incomplete CSS implementation

### Todo Status
Severity: Low

Finding: The todo status filter completed specifically does not highlight all the word 

Symptoms:

For completed when a user hovers the grey color does not highlight the entire word.

### Vite Configuration
Issue: Encountered build problems with Vite configuration

Modifications Made:

Updated vite.config.js

Adjusted module resolutions

Fixed asset loading paths

## Technical Improvements
### Environment Detection
Implementation: Added programmatic server determination via localStorage

Benefits:

Easier environment switching during development

Better configuration management

### Testing Infrastructure
Unit Tests:

Added comprehensive Go tests for backend API

Implemented frontend unit tests for critical components

Performance Tests:

Revised load and spike testing scenarios

Implemented using k6 with realistic user patterns

Added monitoring for:

Response times under load

Error rates during spike tests

System resource utilization

## Recommendations
Priority 1: Implement proper user authentication and data separation

Priority 2: Fix dark theme functionality and add visual regression tests

Priority 3: Enhance performance monitoring with:

Automated alerts for degraded performance

More realistic user behavior simulation

Priority 4: Add end-to-end tests for critical user journeys

## Load Test Report: Node.js vs Golang API Performance

Comparative Analysis
Metric	Node.js	Golang	Difference
Success Rate	9.7%	100%	+90.3%
Error Rate	89.78%	0%	-89.78%
95th %ile Response	1.76ms	3.33ms	+1.57ms
Requests Processed	4,893	5,080	+187
Data Received	5.2MB	10MB	+4.8MB
Findings
Reliability Issues in Node.js:

Extremely high error rate (89.78%)

Only 9.7% of checks passed

POST and GET operations were particularly problematic

Golang Stability:

Perfect success rate across all operations

Slightly higher but still excellent response times

Handled more total requests successfully

Data Volume Difference:

Golang API transferred nearly twice as much data, suggesting more complete responses

Recommendations
Node.js Investigation:

Immediate investigation needed for the high error rate

Review authentication middleware and database connection handling

Check for resource leaks during sustained load

Golang Optimization:

Despite excellent results, explore why response times are slightly higher

Consider connection pooling optimizations

Additional Testing:

Conduct longer duration tests to identify memory leaks

Test with higher VU counts to find breaking points

Implement distributed testing for more realistic loads
